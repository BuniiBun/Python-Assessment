To run this, run the "main.py" file. The goal of this was to extract CSV information and create a JSON report card for the students.

Running "main.py" will get all of the necessary information and organize it in a file named "StudentData.json".

This was a timed assessment. Had I not try to finish this as fast as possible, it would've probably been a bit more tidy
and organized. I completed this from scratch in around 2:32:00 if I remember correctly
